# Cognitive-Task-Classification
Hemodynamic Brain Signal Processing for Cognitive Task Classification
- - - - 
## Ideas

1. A novel algorithm for data-point and feature prediction of  EEG signals for cognitive task classification in Car Driving

2. Backpropagation like algorithms to minimize loss function for prediction on training data (actual environment and not emulated)

3.  Optimization of hyperparameters involved in classifying and /or predicting data-point and feature of EEG signals for the same set of cognitive tasks.

### BCI

Any natural form of communication or control requires peripheral nerves and muscles.
The process begins with the user’s intent. This intent triggers a complex
process in which certain brain areas are activated, and hence signals are sent via
the peripheral nervous system (specifically, the motor pathways) to the corresponding
muscles, which in turn perform the movement necessary for the communication
or control task.

### Measuring Brain Activity

The name 10–20 indicates that the most
commonly used electrodes are positioned 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, and 10% of the total
nasion-inion distance. The other electrodes are placed at similar fractional distances.
The inter-electrode distances are equal along any transverse (from left to right) and
antero-posterior (from front to back) line and the placement is symmetrical.

### Mental Strategies and Brain Patterns

* The mental strategy is the foundation of any brain–computer
communication.
* The mental strategy determines what the user has to do to volitionally
produce brain patterns that the BCI can interpret.
* The most common
mental strategies are selective (focused) attention and motor imagery.

**1. Selective Attention**
* The stimuli can be auditory or somatosensory
* Most BCI's are based on visual stimuli

>A BCI based on selective attention could rely on five stimuli.
Four stimuli are associated with the commands for cursor movement: left, right, up,
and down. The fifth stimulus is for the select command.

* Visual attention can be implemented using two different BCI

- [x] P300 potentials
- [] Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)

>A P300 based BCI relies on stimuli that flash in succession. These stimuli are
usually letters, but can be symbols that represent other goals, such as controlling a
cursor, robot arm, or mobile robot. Selective attention to a specific flashing
symbol/letter elicits a brain pattern called P300, which develops in centro-parietal
brain areas about 300 ms after the presentation of the stimulus.
