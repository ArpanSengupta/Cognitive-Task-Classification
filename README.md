Hemodynamic Brain Signal Processing for Cognitive Task Classification
- - - - 
## Ideas

1. A novel algorithm for data-point and feature prediction of  EEG signals for cognitive task classification in Car Driving

2. Backpropagation like algorithms to minimize loss function for prediction on training data (actual environment and not emulated)

3.  Optimization of hyperparameters involved in classifying and /or predicting data-point and feature of EEG signals for the same set of cognitive tasks.

## BCI

Any natural form of communication or control requires peripheral nerves and muscles.
The process begins with the userâ€™s intent. This intent triggers a complex
process in which certain brain areas are activated, and hence signals are sent via
the peripheral nervous system (specifically, the motor pathways) to the corresponding
muscles, which in turn perform the movement necessary for the communication
or control task.
